Until fall of 2011, the paper had a Monday to Friday circulation of 17,000 during the academic year and generally published in one section. However, each Thursday the paper produced a "Music Notes" section, which chronicled the local music scene and highlights shows and festivals in Athens. On Fridays during football season, the paper publishes the "First & Goal" section to provide in-depth coverage of the Georgia Bulldogs football team. The paper is published once a week during summer session, when it has a circulation of 8,500.

The student paper announced that it would primarily focus on its online content, to better keep up with demand for mobile news access. The paper now publishes a three-sectioned print version, which focuses on in-depth coverage. The website, which contains most of the newspaper's content, contains all of the features and articles previously found in the Monday-to-Friday paper, in addition to audio clips, videos, and other multimedia extras.
